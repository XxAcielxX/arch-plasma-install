## Let's begin
- Grab the latest built ISO Image from **[Arch Linux Download](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)** and write it to an empty USB Stick.
- After the image is done writing, it's time to boot into the Arch Live Environment. First thing you do is:

### Load Keymaps (for non US ENG Keyboard Users only)
For a list of all the available keymaps, use the command:
```
localectl list-keymaps
```

To search for a keymap, use the following command, replacing `[search_term]` with the code for your language, country, or layout:
```
localectl list-keymaps | grep -i [search_term]
```

### Now Loadkeys
```
loadkeys [keymap]
```

### Check for Internet Connectivity
```
ping -c 4 google.com
```
- If you are connected through Ethernet, then your Internet will be working out of the box.
- If you are using Wi-Fi, then use `wifi-menu` to connect to your local network.
- If this step is successful then we will head to next one.

### Update system clock
```
timedatectl set-ntp true
```
</br>

## Preparing the Disk for System

> :warning: Be extremely careful when managing your disks, incase you delete your precious data then DON'T blame me.
Disk partitioning type (use UEFI or MBR, go according to your system).

## For UEFI System

### Disk Partitioning (UEFI)
We are going to make two partitions on our HDD, `EFI BOOT & ROOT` using `gdisk`.
- If you have a brand new HDD or if no partition table is found, then create GPT Partition Table by pressing `g`.
```
gdisk /dev/[disk name]
```
- [disk name] = device to partition, find yours by running `lsblk`.
- We will be using one partition for our `/`, `/boot` & `/home`. 

```
n = New Partition
simply press enter = 1st Partition
simply press enter = As First Sector
+512M = As Last sector (BOOT Partition Size)
ef00 = EFI Partition Type

n = New Partition again
simply press enter = 2nd Partition
simply press enter = As First Sector 
simply press enter = As Last sector [ROOT Partition Size (using the remaining disk space left)]
8300 or simply press enter = EXT4 ROOT Partition Type

w = write & exit
```
### Format Partitions (UEFI)
```
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/[efi partition name]
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[root partiton name] 
```

### Mount Partitions (UEFI)
```
mount /dev/[root partition name] /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/[efi partition name] /mnt/boot/efi
```
## For MBR System

### Disk Partitioning (MBR)
We are going to make two partitions on our HDD, `SWAP & ROOT` using `cfdisk`.
- If you have a brand new HDD or if no partition table is found, then create MSDos Partition Table by selecting `msdos`.
```
cfdisk /dev/[disk name]
```
- [disk name] = device to partition, find yours by running `lsblk`.
- SWAP Partition should double the size of RAM available in your system. Not applicable on 16GB or more RAM.
- We will be using one partition for our `/`, `/boot` & `/home`.

### Format the Partition, Make SWAP & Mount ROOT (MBR)
#### Format ROOT Partition as EXT4
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[root partition name]
```
#### Make & Turn SWAP Partition on (MBR)
```
mkswap /dev/[swap partition name]
swapon /dev/[swap partition name]
```
#### Mount ROOT Partition (MBR)
```
mount /dev/[root partition name] /mnt
```
</br>

## Base System Installation

### Update Mirrors using Reflector
```
reflector -c County1 -c Country2 -a 12 -p https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
Replace `Country1` & `Country2` with countries near to you or with the one you're living in. Refer to **[Reflector](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/reflector)** for more info.

### Install base system
```
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware linux-headers nano intel-ucode reflector mtools dosfstools
```
- Replace `linux` with *linux-hardened*, *linux-lts* or *linux-zen* to install the kernel of your choice.
- Replace `linux-headers` with Kernel type type of your choice respectively (e.g if you installed `linux-zen` then you will need `linux-zen-headers`).
- Replace `nano` with editor of your choice (i.e `vim` or `vi`).
- Replace `intel-ucode` with `amd-ucode` if you are using an AMD Processor.

### Generate fstab
(use `-U` or `-L` to define by [UUID](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UUID) or labels, respectively)
```
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```
Check the resulting `/mnt/etc/fstab` file, and edit it in case of errors. 
</br>

## Chroot

```
arch-chroot /mnt
```
### Create Swapfile (UEFI only)
Replace the below 4096 in `count=4096` with double the amount of RAM installed your system. Not applicable on 16GB or more RAM.
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096 status=progress
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
```

### Add Swapfile entery in your `/etc/fstab` file (UEFI only) 
```
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```
Insert the above line at the bottom of `/etc/fstab`.

### Set Time & Date
```
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```
Replace `Region` & `City` according to your Time zone. Refer to **[Time zone](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Time_zone)** more info.

## Set Language
We will use `en_US.UTF-8` here but, if you want to set your language, replace `en_US.UTF-8` with yours in all below instances.

#### Edit locale.gen
```
nano /etc/locale.gen
```
Uncomment the below line
```
#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
```
save & exit.

### Generate Locale
```
locale-gen
```

### Add LANG to locale.conf
```
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
```

### Add Keymaps to vconsole
For keyboard users with non US Eng only. Replace `[keymap]` with yours.
```
echo "KEYMAP=[keymap]" > /etc/vconsole.conf
```

## Set Hostname

```
echo arch > /etc/hostname
```
Replace `arch` with hostname of your choice.

### Set Hosts
```
nano /etc/hosts
```
#### add these lines to it
```
127.0.0.1    localhost
::1          localhost
127.0.1.1    arch.localdomain arch
```
Replace `arch` with hostname of your choice.
save & exit.

```

#### For MBR System
```
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/[disk name]
```

### Create Grub configuration file
```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Final Step
```
exit 
umount -a
reboot
```
</br>

## Now boot into your freshly installed Arch system

### Login as ROOT

### Add new User

Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
My favourite theme is Powerlevel10k (follow below for installation).
- You can visit [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) to download theme of your choice.

### Get [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/) Theme for Oh My Zsh
This is the theme I'll install to spice up my terminal experience.
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

#### Get the recommended fonts
We will be using ***Yay*** to install the below two packages as one of them is only available from AUR.
```
yay -S ttf-dejavu ttf-meslo-nerd-font-powerlevel10k
```
Also set your Konsole Terminal font to `MesloGS-NF-Regular`.

#### Set Powerlevel10k as your Zsh Theme
```
nano ~/.zshrc
```
Find the line starting with `ZSH_THEME="...."` and replace the theme name so the line should now look like this `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` Now do `source ~/.zshrc`.
#### Configuration
> ***For new users***, on the first run, Powerlevel10k configuration wizard will ask you a few questions and configure your prompt. If it doesn't trigger automatically, type `p10k configure`. Configuration wizard creates `~/.p10k.zsh` based on your preferences. Additional prompt customization can be done by editing this file.
